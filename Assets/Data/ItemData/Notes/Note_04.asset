  itemDescription: 'I''ve cleaned more today than I have in my entire life. Day in,
    day out, just pools of sick and blood, it''s almost neverending.


    Ever since
    those two groups came back in a few days ago, everything changed. It''s like
    they brought back with them a plague that''s slowly making everyone, including
    me, sick, and violent. '
