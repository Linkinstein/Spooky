  itemDescription: "I don't know what this is, or how I got it, but it looks beautiful.
    \n\nIt's curvaceous exterior, alongside its studded accents on the sides, and
    its golden color, makes it shine even in the inky blackness.\n\nFor whatever
    reason, it felt important, important enough for it to somehow end up in my hand,
    and for someone to leave instructions in my backpack (TAB -> C)."
