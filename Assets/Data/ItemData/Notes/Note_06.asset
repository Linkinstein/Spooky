  itemDescription: 'I''ve lost track of time, how long have I been here? The job
    was supposed to be easy, just an in-and-out extraction of a non-combatant, research
    team.


    But just as we reached the top, the lift''s gubbins gave in, and
    sent us falling to our deaths. I looked to be the only survivor, and, the only
    one left at the scene of the shattered remains of what was once the lift we stood
    on.


    My first instinct was to get back up, but once I got my bearings, I
    felt something in my hands.'
